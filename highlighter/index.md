## Highlighter

I used to write a lot of essays, and reports when I was in university. I developed Highlighter in order to help me highlight interesting ideas that I came across on the internet. This tool can store those highlights on your local so that you can check them back later.

## INSTALLATION

- After installing the extension from chrome web store, it is recommended to refresh all the tabs or reopen the browser.

## CURRENT FEATURES

- Highlight selected text
