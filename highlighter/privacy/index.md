# Privacy Policy

### 1. OVERVIEW

LeNoob provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of information that apply to our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. We take the privacy of our users very seriously. We do not sell your personal data, neither your email address, nor any personal information on how you use LeNoob to external parties. We also do not record users’ browsing history, except for the pages you specifically highlight/annotate/bookmark to our servers.

### 2. CHILDREN

Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to enjoy LeNoob’s services. For children under 13, in the future, LeNoob will offer a limited feature set and website experience. If we receive any reports from the user or from user’s teacher that the user is under the age of 13, we will terminate the service now and in the future may offer a limited version of the website that removes social features such as a public profile if we plan to implement a public profile in the future.

### 3. PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

To use the LeNoob service, an email address, username and password are required. That’s it. We use personally identifiable information to deliver the Service, to comply with reasonable requests of law enforcement and recommend additional content to you.

We collect information that can be used to identify you as an individual (“Personally Identifiable Information”) only when you provide such information directly to us in connection with the Service. We ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and e-mail address when you register for the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service and technical staff.

### 5. NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

We also collect and use information about your interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does not identify you as an individual (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). We may collect, use, and disclose Non-Personally Identifiable Information as set forth below.

Analytics Information: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your application as part of a page request and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.

Log File Information: When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device type, number of highlights and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, and other such information.

### 6. SECURITY

LeNoob is very concerned with safeguarding your information. LeNoob uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from LeNoob, at all times. You are also responsible for not contributing any private Content, such as passwords, through actions such as highlighting or annotating.

### 7. REFERRAL SERVICE AND REQUESTING REFERENCES

LeNoob may provide a referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use LeNoob. We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation messages or requests for references via the third party site itself. You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the contact information to which to send your invitation/request. You can type in the email addresses or other contact information manually, or you can choose to import the contacts in your address book(s). In both cases, we may use and store this information for the sole purposes of allowing you to send your friends and contacts an invitation or request for a reference, and for fraud detection and prevention. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email addresses of your invitees to track if your friend joins LeNoob in response to your referral.

Therefore you must look at the Terms & Privacy Policies regularly to check for such changes. If you do not agree to the Modified Terms you must stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the date the Modified Terms are posted will constitute your acceptance of the Modified Terms.
